## H-HOPE Assesment tool
The H-Hope Assessment Tool is an Google-Sheet based assessment tool aimed for stakeholders such as Utility Companies, Local Municipalities, Remote Communities, Energy Companies, and others that are interested in deploying and installed DO IT YOURSELF (DIY)H-Hope Energy Harvesters technology into existing urban water system infrastructure to generate energy to power various potential application such as self-power monitoring system, small energy generation for batteries to power valves in the system, and energy generation for small local consumption or backup energy in case of emergency.

The H-HOPE Assesment-tool is available here: This site was built using [H-HOPE Assesment tool](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LuZQPRvfYULUB2h-VDST4QxazxZZUS7gDjoAN001Wdg/edit?gid=1594760598#gid=1594760598).

The tool aims to provide the stakeholder ways to assessment, first) the technology feasibility of H-Hope technology in relation to the water system parameters such as water velocity in the location of installation, which will provide the user with an understanding of the potentail energy output from installing one energy harvester or a series of energy harvester upto 30 harvesters. Second) The risk assessment in relation to water system data inputs, and energy harvester design, which will provide the user with insights into potentail limitation and risks that can impact the operational reliability of the energy harvester, and impact the feasibility of installation. Third) The environmental impact associate with both the material profile of the selected harvesters, and the installation and deployment of the energy harvester into stakeholder proposed water system, and infrastructure, which will provide the user with information on the environmental impact of manufacturing, and total life cycle of one or units of energy harvester being installed, as well as the environmental impact of producing one unit of energy using the energy harvester. Lastly, fourth) The economic feasibility and benefits associated with installation and deployment of the energy harvester to the proposed water system and infrastructure, which will provide the user with information of economic costs of producing one unit of energy using the energy harvester, payback time, and rate of return of investment to stakeholder, therefore giving the user an understand of the economic feasibility of deploying and installing the H-Hope Energy technology.
The tool is interactive process, and information intensive process, which is enable to give the user holistic and overview feasibility results concerning the installation  and deployment of the H-Hope energy harvester technology to an existing water system infrastructure for various utilization.

This version of the H-Hope_Assessment_Tool is the Newest Version of H-Hope assessment tool and is being shared for practical application of stakeholder interested and concerning projects related to the installation and deployment of DIY H-Hope Energy in an existing water system infrastructure, and to encourage application and discussion of the tool usability.

## H-HOPE DIY Calculator		
		
The H-HOPE DIY Device Power and Dimensions Calculator is a tool designed to determine the optimal dimensions of and H-HOPE harvester cylinder based on user-provided inputs, specified input parameters, the calculator provides two sets of results: DIY output and 1D model output, such as water speed and the depth and width of a river or channel. In addition to calculating	the ideal cylinder size, the tool also estimates the mechanical power output. Using the specified input parameters, the calculator provides two sets of results: DIY output and 1D model output.		
		
The H-HOPE Calculator provides detailed economic and environmental analyses for evaluating the performance and sustainability	of an H-HOPE harvester over its lifetime. The results are categorized into Economic Output and Environmental Analysis (LCA)	Output, offering insights into both financial viability and ecological impact.
